\title{Determinants of Economic Growth}
\format{
A data frame with 72 observations on 11 variables:
\describe{
\item{country}{factor. Name of the country.}
\item{gdpgrowth}{Average growth rate of GDP per capita from 1960 - 1996 at
purchasing power parity.}
\item{lgdp60}{Logarithm of GDP per capita in 1960.}
\item{equipinv}{Average real equipment investment share of GDP from
1960 - 1985 comprising investments in electrical and nonelectrical machinery
(in relative prices constant across countries).}
\item{school60}{Enrollment rate for primary education in 1960.}
\item{life60}{Life expectancy at age 0 in 1960.}
\item{popgrowth}{Average growth rate of population from 1960 - 1996.}
\item{law}{Index for the overall maintenance of the rule of law ('law and
order tradition').}
\item{tropics}{Proportion of country's land area within geographical tropics.}
\item{avelf}{Average of five different indices of ethnolinguistic
fragmentation which is measured as the probability of two random people
in a country not sharing the same language.}
\item{confuc}{Fraction of Confucian population in 1970 and 1980.}

\description{
Growth regression data used in \insertCite{magnus2010growth;textual}{WALS}.
}
\details{
The dataset is used in \insertCite{magnus2010growth;textual}{WALS}
to illustrate the WALS model averaging approach and combines the data used in
\insertCite{sala2004bace;textual}{WALS} and \insertCite{sala1997reg;textual}{WALS}.
See the references for more detailed descriptions and original sources of the
variables.

## Replicate table on p. 534 of De Luca & Magnus (2011)
fitDM <- wals(gdpgrowth ~ lgdp60 + equipinv + school60 + life60 + popgrowth |
                  law + tropics + avelf + confuc, data = GrowthMPP,
                prior = laplace())
tableDM <- cbind("coef" = coef(fitDM), "se" = sqrt(diag(vcov(fitDM))))
print(round(tableDM, 7))


## Replicate Table 2 in Magnus et al. (2010)
## NOTE: prescale = FALSE, still used old version of WALS in Magnus et al. (2010).
## Not recommended anymore!
fitMPP <- wals(gdpgrowth ~ lgdp60 + equipinv + school60 + life60 + popgrowth |
                  law + tropics + avelf + confuc, data = GrowthMPP,
                prior = laplace(), prescale = FALSE)
tableMPP <- cbind("coef" = coef(fitMPP), "se" = sqrt(diag(vcov(fitMPP))))
print(round(tableMPP, 4))
